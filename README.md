### How It Works

The game initializes with a random circle lighting up, signifying the start of the sequence. As players progress, the sequence grows. To play, users should replicate the sequence by clicking on the circles in the correct order.

---

### App.js Overview

The heart of the twinkle-circle lies within the App.js file, a fundamental component that drives the entire application. Utilizing the power of React's hooks, such as useState, useEffect, and useRef, this component orchestrates the game logic, interaction, and flow. It seamlessly integrates various components, including the header, circles, control panel, and even a custom toast notification for user feedback. The game operates on a sequence mechanism, wherein a random sequence of circle colors is generated and played, with the player's objective being to replicate this sequence. The code is modular, ensuring readability and ease of maintenance.
